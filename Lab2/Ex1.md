#Exercise 1

 * Created AM signal
 * Obeyed the equation given in the notes
 * PSD of modulated signal had two sidebands


###Ex1.1.png block diagram
###ex1.2 png plot

 * Changing AM to give mu of {.5, 1, 1.5} 
 * Increasing mu changes the AM signal
  * at 1 the modulated signal's lowest point is 0, however going being that leads to the message signal being bigger than the carrier and losing some of the data 
  * Aliasing

###ex1.3a/b/c - think harder too

 * Changing message frequency as {1k, 2k, 5k}
 * Aliasing as message frequency approaches carrier frequency
  * Technically carrier is sampling the message, reaching Nyquist frequency

###ex1.4a/b/c - make some more notes twat
