#Exercise 2

###Insert maths here + ex2a.png

 * Made coherant Demodulator
 * Hopefully it works
 * Scaling issues
 * Have to multiply demodulated signal by 2
  * However input carrier is not normalised, so have to divide by the amplitude of carrier
   * Or normalise carrier, but that was more wiring



###Insert maths here and ex2B.pNg

 * Made envelope detector
 * Hopefully it works
 * Needed to pass through all the waveform properties from Waveform Properties to Build Waveform
