#Exercise 3


 * Wired up three sine waves, and added them up
  * FFT PSD module
  * Two adder blocks, as extending one adder block to do three gave me an error
  * Filter added

 * Filter changed to a bandpass filter with cut off frequencies of 25 and 35
 * This let mostly only the sine wave at 30Hz through
