##Implementation of CLT 

 * Nested for Loop, inside while loop
 * Inner for loop generates a random number which is summed up
 * This is done n1*n2 times (product of iterations of both for loops)
 * Average is taken to get 'sample mean' via Add Array Elements + divide 
 * Insert into Array block is used
  * Average is fed into New element
  * Index is the while loop iteration counter (so to increment array)
  * Array output is taken 'through the right wall' of the while loop using a shift register
  * Then fed back in from the left side into the Array terminal
  * This ensures the data is transferred from one iteration to the other and the array grows
 * Tested with 10 milliseconds to wait, and 100 bins
